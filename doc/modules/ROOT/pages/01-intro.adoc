[#is]
== What this is

* An illustrated and opinionated HowTo on how I prefer to set up RHODS environments
// * A quick way of doing so, if you follow along
// * An opinionated set of sequential steps to get RHODS setup quickly
// * A copy of various instructions that can be found in various other xref:#ref[sources].

[#isnot]
== What this is NOT

This is NOT:

* A replacement for the entire and complete link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_science/1[documentation]
* A way to build production-grade environments
* Going to be the best design for all situations

[#timing]
== Timing

* Going through these steps will take anywhere between 30 minutes and a few hours
** The first time is going to take the longest
** If you already have your cluster ready, it will be a lot faster
