= Configure the default RHODS Authorization

== Rationale

Currently (at least up to RHODS V1.3.0-6), the way that RHODS Authorization defaults are configured, anyone who tries to log in will not be recognized as a RHODS user.

Instead, they will be met with `403: forbidden` error when they try to launch a notebook:

Although this is link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_science/1/html-single/getting_started_with_red_hat_openshift_data_science/index#i_see_a_emphasis_role_strong_403_forbidden_emphasis_error_when_i_log_in_to_jupyterhub[documented], I belive it's a better experience to reconfigure the authentication is way that:

* any OpenShift User is automatically recognized as a RHODS user
* any OpenShift Cluster-Admin is recognized as a RHODS admin

== Edit Configmap

* Locate the configmap `rhods-groups-config` in the `redhat-ods-applications` namespace
+

+
* Edit the YAML of the configmap
+

image::edit.configmap.png[configmap edit]
+
* Modify the content so that:
** `opendatahub.io/modified:` is set to `true`
** `admin_groups:` is set to `cluster-admins`
** `allowed_groups:` is set to `'system:authenticated'`
* WARNING: It's very easy to forget the first out of the three lines mentioned above.
** (Not that it has happened to me or anything. It happened ... to a friend.)
* The result should look like:

+
* Click save

**Note:** These changes will not take effect until you restart all the JupyterHub pods. This is covered in the next section.

== Do a rollout of the JupyterHub Pods

* Locate the `jupyterhub` DeploymentConfig in the `redhat-ods-applications` namespace
+

+
* Wait until all 3 `jupyterhub` pods have restarted, and one is **Running 2/2**:

+
* At this point, the changes in Authorization should be fully active.
* The next section will validate that we can successfully use RHODS, by launching a Jupyter Notebook.

== Progress
