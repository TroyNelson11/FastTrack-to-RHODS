= Configure OpenShift Authentication

CAUTION: Under construction

[#htpasswd]
== Configure HTPasswd as and auth provider

This is a good option to use if you just need a single user, or if you want to start by creating an Cluster Administrator account.

* go to console.
* select your cluster
* "Access control" tab
* in Identity providers:
** add identity provider
** choose HTpasswd
** keep default ("HTPasswd")
** use the suggested name and password. (but save them somewhere)
** click add
* under "Cluster Roles and Access"
** click Add Users
** enter the name of the admin account that you just created
** choose `cluster-admin`
** Click Add User

To confirm, Click on the blue button (Open Console).

Enter the credentials

Confirm you can log in

[#github]
== Configure GitHub as an authentication provider

Github can be used as a fairly easy way to setup authentication if your environment will be accessible by multiple users.

The assumption is that it's ok

=== Create a github org

=== configure that org as auth provider

=== Make your Github user a cluster-admin

=== Invite your users to your github org
