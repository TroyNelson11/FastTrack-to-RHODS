= Validation

At this stage, and before you modify and/or customize your RHODS environment in any way, it's a good time to confirm that your users can access it. +
These steps will walk you (an admin) through some basics.

[#logindashboard]
== 4.1 Log into RHODS

[#rhodsurl]
=== Get the RHODS URL

* From the OpenShift Console, click on the application Switcher, and choose Red Hat OpenShift Data Science.
+

+
* This URL is the main RHODS URL, and the only one that you need to share with your RHODS end-users.
* Save it or Bookmark it for later reference.

[#authenticate]
=== Authenticate

* Click on the **Log in with OpenShift** button (from the screenshot above).
* You will be prompted with one or more Authentication Choices depending on how your OpenShift Authentication is configured.

CAUTION: Under construction
  need a screenshot here

* Choose the Authentication Method that works best for you, and enter credentials if required.
* If all goes well, you should now see the Red Hat OpenShift Data Science dashboard

[#spawn]
=== Spawn a JupyterHub Notebook

* On the next screen, select ...

CAUTION: Under construction

[#getstarted]
== 4.2 Get your users started with RHODS

Assuming the steps above were successful, your environment should be ready for use. +
To get your users started with it:

* Share the URL captured above, so they can access RHODS directly
* If there is more than one Authentication Methods defined in your OpenShift, +
  let your users know which one they should be using.
* If your users are un-familiar with RHODS, they should consult the link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-data-science/getting-started/launch-red-hat-openshift-data-science[RHODS Learning path], which will guide them through the first steps.

== Progress
