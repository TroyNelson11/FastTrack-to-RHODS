= Get RHODS

If you don't already have a Managed OpenShift Cluster available, go back to the "xref:02-get.a.managed.openshift.adoc[Get a Managed OpenShift]" section.

If you already have a Managed OpenShift Cluster, and have confirmed that it meets the minimum xref:02-get.a.managed.openshift.adoc#cluster-requirements[cluster requirements] for RHODS, then deploying RHODS on it should only take a couple clicks.

== Progress
