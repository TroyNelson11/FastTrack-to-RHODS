If you want the documented method, please refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_science/1/html/managing_users_and_user_resources/adding-users-for-openshift-data-science_useradd[documentation].


== Edit Configmap

* locate the configmap called "rhods-groups-config" in the namespace called "redhat-ods-applications"

* Edit the YAML of the configmap
* ensure that opendatahub.io/modified: is set to 'true'
* ensure that admin_groups is set to cluster-admins
* ensure that allowed_groups is set to   'system:authenticated'
(with the single quotes)
* this means that any authenticated OpenShift User is then also a RHODS user and any cluster-admin is also a RHODS admin
